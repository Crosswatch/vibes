        <h1>Privacy Policy for Crosswatch</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last Updated: January 8, 2026</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Crosswatch does not collect, store, or share any personal data. All your workout data stays on your device.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Crosswatch ("we", "our", or "the app") is a workout timer application designed to help users with HIIT, CrossFit, 
            and circuit training workouts. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Crosswatch does not collect any personal information.</strong> The app operates entirely offline and does not:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
            <li>Track your location</li>
            <li>Access your contacts, photos, or other personal files</li>

            <li>Transmit any data over the internet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
        <p>
            All workout data you create in Crosswatch is stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms provided 
            by your operating system. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Workout settings and preferences</li>
            <li>App configuration settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data never leaves your device and is only accessible to the Crosswatch app on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            Crosswatch may request the following permissions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To alert you when workout intervals complete (optional, can be disabled)</li>
            <li><strong>Wake Lock:</strong> To keep your screen on during workouts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These permissions are used solely for app functionality and do not involve data collection.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

        </p>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to your information 
            through our app. Your workout data remains secure on your device, protected by your device's security measures.
