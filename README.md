## JSON Workout Schema

Workouts are defined in JSON format:

### Workout Object
```json
{
  "name": "Workout Name",
  "description": "Optional description",
  "sets": [...]
}
```

### Set Object
Sets can be **leaf sets** (exercises) or **container sets** (groups):

**Leaf Set (Exercise):**
```json
{
  "name": "Push-ups",
  "description": "Standard push-ups",
  "type": "reps",           // or "time"
  "value": 20,              // reps or seconds
  "duration": 60,           // optional: max time for rep exercises
  "transitionTime": 5,      // optional: prep time (default: 5s)
  "rounds": 1,              // optional: repeat count (default: 1)
  "restBetweenRounds": 30   // optional: rest between rounds
}
```

**Container Set (Group):**
```json
{
  "name": "Main Circuit",
  "description": "3 rounds for time",
  "sets": [...],            // nested sets
  "rounds": 3,              // repeat count
  "restBetweenRounds": 60,  // rest between rounds
  "transitionTime": 5       // prep time before starting
}
```

**Special Values:**
- `transitionTime: 0` - No prep time, start immediately (useful for rest periods)
- `type: null` - Container set (must have nested `sets` array)

See `assets/workouts/` for complete examples.

### Dev Dependencies
- **flutter_test** - Testing framework
- **flutter_lints** `^6.0.0` - Linting rules

## Architecture

### State Management
- **Provider pattern** for workout timer state
- `WorkoutTimerProvider` manages:
  - Exercise progression and transitions
  - Timer state (running/paused/stopped)
  - Rest periods and round counting
  - Audio and notification triggers

### Timer Logic Flow
1. **Workout Flattening**: Nested workout structure converted to flat exercise list
2. **Phase System**: Each exercise has transition phase (prep) and active phase
3. **Round Management**: Exercises repeat with rest periods between rounds
4. **Countdown**: Audio beeps at 5-4-3-2-1 seconds (uses `ceil()` for display)
5. **Transitions**: 1-second delay between exercises to avoid audio collision

### Cross-Platform Audio
- **Linux**: Uses `paplay` command with bundled `.oga` files
- **Android/iOS**: Uses `audioplayers` package with asset sources
- Automatic platform detection with fallback support

### Cross-Platform Notifications
- **Android**: `AndroidNotificationDetails` with workout channel
- **iOS**: `DarwinNotificationDetails` with alerts and sounds
- **Linux**: `LinuxNotificationDetails` with urgency levels

## Development

### Adding New Workouts

Create a JSON file in `assets/workouts/` following the schema above, then add it to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/workouts/
```

### Modifying Timer Behavior

Key file: `lib/providers/workout_timer_provider.dart`

Important methods:
- `_flattenWorkout()` / `_flattenSet()` - Converts nested structure to flat list
- `_initializeExercise()` - Sets up transition/active phases
- `_onTimerComplete()` - Handles phase transitions
- `_moveToNextExercise()` - Advances to next exercise with rest periods

### Testing on Physical Devices

**Android:**
```bash
# Enable USB debugging on your device
adb devices
flutter install
# Or drag-and-drop the APK from build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```

**iOS:**
```bash
flutter run -d <device-id>
# Requires Apple Developer account for physical devices
```

### Common Issues

**Linux Audio Not Working:**
- Ensure PulseAudio is installed: `which paplay`
- Check audio service initialization in logs

**Android Build Errors:**
- Verify NDK is installed: `~/Android/Sdk/ndk/`
- Accept licenses: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`
- Clear build cache: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

**Notifications Not Showing:**
- Check notification permissions in device settings
- Verify notification channel is created (Android)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Follow Flutter style guide** - run `flutter analyze` before committing
3. **Test on multiple platforms** if possible
4. **Update documentation** for new features
5. **Add example workouts** for new exercise types
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Code Style
- Use `flutter format .` to format code
- Follow Material Design guidelines for UI
- Add comments for complex timer logic
- Use meaningful variable names

### Testing
```bash
flutter test
flutter analyze
```

## Roadmap
